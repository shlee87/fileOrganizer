## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Initial Setup
1. User accesses UI at `http://localhost:8080`
2. If service stopped, see clear "Service Not Running" message
3. Click "Configuration" to set workplace and destination paths
4. Use file browser to select directories
5. Click "Test Configuration" to validate paths
6. Click "Start Service" to begin file monitoring
7. Dashboard shows "Service Running" with live activity

### Workflow 2: Daily Monitoring
1. User checks dashboard for service status
2. Reviews "Today's Activity" summary
3. If failures exist, clicks to see error details
4. Can reprocess failed files with single click
5. Views processing statistics to track trends

### Workflow 3: Troubleshooting Issues
1. User notices files not being processed
2. Checks service status (should be green/running)

├── Logs (Viewer, Search, Export)
└── Statistics (Charts, Metrics)
```

### State Management
- **Service State**: status, uptime, stats
