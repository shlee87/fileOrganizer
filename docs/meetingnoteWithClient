# Meeting Notes with Client

- He is an attorney based on LA in the US.
- His major workflow are two. One is to corporate a startup who wants to have a corporation in the US from South Korea
While working this flow, he wants to automate document generation and organization. Many startups wants to be incorporated in Delaware. And Delaware requiers many documents to approve their incorporation.
He wants to automate the document generation and organization for this flow. The other is to consult on a specific legal issues.

- His painpoints while working are two. First, he doesn't want to spend too much time on document management and organization.So if there is a program that sorts files into folders based on its filename info, it will save his time.

- as an agency to solve his problem, my plan is like this

the file name would be like this 

ex) restricted stock purchase agreement_[clientnames]_[date]_[status].pdf

if this file has been signed and its file name is updated to include the status, it shoud move to a folder based on its filename info.
